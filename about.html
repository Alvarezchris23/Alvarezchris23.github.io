    <p>Everything Soccer is a website created by 16 year old Chrisitan Alvarez. Before, it was a website that was really about Messi, Neymar, and Ronaldo, but Christian thought, why not change it up a bit? Now it's really just more a soccer website with bits of randomness here and there. But, it's still soccer related so don't worry. Here is a basic overview of what soccer is, as explained by Merriam-Webster, LOLOLOL! Soccer is  a game played on a field between two teams of 11 players each with the object to propel a round ball into the opponent's goal by kicking or by hitting it with any part of the body except the hands and arms. Now go out there and do it!</p>
